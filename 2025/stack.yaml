# A snapshot resolver dictates the compiler version and the set of packages
# to be used for all local packages. See https://www.stackage.org/snapshots
# for a list of available resolvers.

# resolver: lts-24.22
resolver: lts-23.28

# User packages to be built.
# Various formats can be used as shown in the example below.
